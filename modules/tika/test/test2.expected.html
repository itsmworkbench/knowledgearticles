<p>Elastic Search</p>
<p/>
<p>Context</p>
<p>This is a ‘technical test’ to allow you to demonstrate your elastic search skills. We want you (on your own box, or in elastic search cloud as you choose) demonstrate the following. We will have a video meeting with screen share and look over the work at the end. </p>
<p/>
<p>Timescales</p>
<p>We will have a meeting on Wednesday 8th to review the results </p>
<p>Data feed</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>We have a data feed from a Github organisation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The organisation has members</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The organisation has repositories</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Load some of the files from this repository for searching (you can pick… you can even do it manually if you want, but scripting/code is far better)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>We want to set up document level security for this</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p/>
<p>
    A suitable organisation is this
    <a href="https://github.com/run-book">
        <u>https://github.com/run-book</u>
    </a>
    or you can make your own, or use any other. The sample organisation only has two members.
</p>
<p/>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            We want to use the document level security as per
            <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/field-and-document-access-control.html">
                <u>https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/field-and-document-access-control.html</u>
            </a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Only people from the organisation and members of a specific group that you create can access their documents in search</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I don’t want heavy configuration: this should be mostly a data exercise</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>While I don’t care about the importing of data, it’s important that the organisation data (who works for that organisation) is automated in some way</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Not goals</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>We don’t care about the authentication mechanism. Use whatever you want</p>
    </li>
</ul>
